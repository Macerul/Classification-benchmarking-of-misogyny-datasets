# Classification-benchmarking-of-misogyny-datasets
 In this study, we organized and cleaned misogyny datasets collected by online sources and provided classification results obtained employing machine learning models and extracting feature approaches.
 The repository is organised as follows:
 -Datasets: it is possible to find public and preprocessed datasets.
 -Scores: it contains all the details about the results obtained in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1.
